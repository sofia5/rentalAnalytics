# Rental analytics

## Project description

This project features a set of data from surveys by residents in rentals. It shows when the survey was carried out, how many people responded (answer rate, count), type of survey & project as well as integration.
If you want, it's possible to mark the surveys as favorites, and filter them out to make the list easier to overview.

Some thought on improvements:

- Cookies / storing the selectedFavorites would be good so that these are kept when reloading the page
- Handling of more surveys & survey details
